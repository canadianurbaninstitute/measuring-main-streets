		Main streets were experiencing serious headwinds before the onset of the pandemic in the form of competition from shopping malls and shifting consumer behavior to online retailing. At the outset of the pandemic there were many doomsday predictions for main streets as online retailing spiked. It was seen as an acceleration of on inevitable trend that would lead to the shuttering of many bricks and mortar (independent) businesses. While there are a stack of related challenges facing local small business communities, the trends of consumer choices between main streets, malls, and online have not been linear or as catastrophic as some had predicted. This brief sorts out how the pandemic impacted consumer behaviors and what lessons can be learned for main street resiliency. The primary message is that main streets need to be central to building distinct local communities in order to best position themselves relative to shopping malls and online commerce.

			<h3>Visitor Levels</h3> 
			<p>
				For the Measuring Main Streets project we tracked the visitor levels of 60 main streets and 15 regional shopping malls in the Toronto, Montreal, and Edmonton regions. The streets were chosen to be representative of location, form, and demographics/equity. These were grouped into three broad categories of downtown (workplace oriented), small town, and urban/suburban (residential oriented). The visitor data dates to the beginning of 2019 and enables the comparison of visitor levels through to the end of 2022 on a monthly basis for individual streets or groups of streets according to type. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The pandemic began to heavily impact the lives of Canadians in March of 2020. Hard lockdowns were imposed in many places while fear and uncertainty dominated personal decisions. During these early months visitor levels to main streets and malls dropped off precipitously. By April 2020, visitor levels to all types of main streets in Toronto, Montreal and Edmonton fell by at least half with downtown main streets dropping below 30% of pre-pandemic levels. Regional shopping malls were the most affected by hard lockdowns, falling to 15% of pre-pandemic visitor levels. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Recovery trajectories also varied significantly by specific context. Small town main streets and residentially oriented main streets recovered more quickly than ones in downtowns. Much of this was due to a shift to work-from-home arrangements that heavily impacted office tower occupancy in city centers. As people worked from home more often, they are likely to have shifted some of their consumption patterns to their neighbourhood main street. By the end of 2022, 9 out of the 75 case study main streets and shopping malls had fully recovered (or exceeded 2019 visitor levels). Five of these main streets were in small towns and four anchored residential neighbourhoods. Regional shopping malls typically experienced a series of V-shaped sharp declines and rebounds in relation to hard lockdowns. In aggregate, these spiky patterns did not add up to a full recovery for the studied malls by the 2022. Overall, regional shopping malls outperformed main streets in 2022 despite another decline in the final two months. People seemed more comfortable returning to malls in greater numbers sooner than to most main streets. Shopping malls tend to invest in creating perceptions of safety and security. Part of this effort involves crafting consistent and cohesive environments where people know what to expect. Main streets can draw some longer-term lessons from this, while trying to avoid risks associated with sterility and conformity.

			<h3>Civic Infrastructure</h3> 
			<p>
				Regional shopping malls do not typically provide the same range of offerings as main streets. Measuring Main Streets identifies businesses (retail; bars & restaurants; local services) and civic infrastructure (arts & culture; recreation; education; health & care; government & community services) that are commonly found in main street environments. For the average main street, civic infrastructure accounts for slightly more than 20% of all establishments â€“ though for some it is significantly higher. This is contrast to regional shopping malls where on average civic infrastructure accounts for only 8% of establishments. Only one regional shopping center in the study (Millwoood Town Center) provides civic infrastructure at the rate of typical main street.

			<h3>Independent Businesses</h3> 
			<p>
				A key difference between main streets and regional shopping centers is the extent to which they support independent business. Measuring Main Streets developed an Independent Index to assess the relative balance between one-off independent businesses and establishments that are parts of chains. The index considers the size of the chain so that smaller local ones are not equated with large international chains. A score closer to one means that an area has a greater share of independent business relative to chains (and closer to zero should be read as a higher share of chain businesses). The average Independent Business Index score for the 60 main street case studies was 0.74 in comparison to 0.30 for the 15 regional shopping malls. Main streets clearly provide significantly more opportunities for locally owned independent business. Such businesses are also more likely to provides goods and services that are more closely aligned with the nuances of local communities.

			<h3>Distance Travelled</h3> 
			<p>
				Regional shopping malls tend to serve a wider catchment area than neighbourhood oriented main streets. The average trip distance to the 15 regional shopping malls in 2022 was 10km versus 7.8km for neigbourhood main streets. Small town and downtown mains streets trip distance profiles are more aligned with that of regional shopping malls than neighbourhood main streets but for different reasons. Small town main streets typically serve low-density and rural communities while downtowns main streets draw people from all parts of the city. Average trip distances to all types of main streets as well as shopping malls fell significantly through the pandemic (2020-2021) before beginning to revert to historical levels in 2022. As people travelled less during the pandemic there were significant reductions in average household greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020 there was a reduction of 17.3% in 2020 followed by a further drop of 0.5% in 2021 (Statistics Canada 2022). This highlights the possible environmental benefits of providing essential goods and services on main streets in more densely populated neighbourhoods.

			<h3>Ecommerce</h3> 
			<p>
				As all types of physical locations showed declines in activity in the early stages of the pandemic, e-commerce boomed. April 2020 saw that share of e-commerce of all retail trade rise above 10% for the first time. Prior to the pandemic, e-commerce accounted for a rising share of the value of retail transactions but had yet to breach the 4% mark. This sudden spike led to many predictions that this was an inevitable acceleration of an existing trend that would continue beyond the end of the pandemic. These predictions did not come to fruition as e-commerce stayed well above expected levels for the core two years of the pandemic before retreating to the historic trend. While the pandemic does not seem to have accelerated a consumer shift to online retail, the long-term pattern rate continues to steadily rise.

			<h3>Restaurants</h3> 
			<p>
				There was also a notable increase in online orders for restaurant meals during the pandemic. By 2021 online restaurant revenue had risen by an estimated 90% from pre-pandemic (2019) amounts (DoorDash/Restaurants Canada, 2022) This was a lifesaver for many main street businesses that saw their in-person dining levels evaporate in the early stages of the pandemic. The trajectory of restaurant revenues was very similar to that of regional shopping malls in that there were very sharp drop-offs during hard lockdowns and quick recoveries (see figure). Full-service restaurants and drinking places (bars) experienced deeper loses of revenue than limited-service restaurants (fast food) as they are almost entirely dependent on in-person consumption. Fast food restaurants were better positioned to adjust through online orders, deliveries, and service windows. As a result, they managed to exceed pre-pandemic sales levels by the summer of 2021. The downside to (independent) businesses is that many online ordering and deliveries are mediated by third parties that capture most, if not all, of the extra revenue (McKinsey). The potential downside to main streets is that more people choosing to staying home rather than visiting in person reduces the overall vibrancy and experience which can in turn undermine general recovery efforts.
