			Main streets were experiencing serious headwinds before the onset of the pandemic in the form
			of competition from shopping malls and shifting consumer behavior to online retailing. At the
			outset of the pandemic there were many doomsday predictions for main streets as online
			retailing spiked. It was seen as an acceleration of on inevitable trend that would lead to the
			shuttering of many bricks and mortar (independent) businesses. While there are a stack of
			related challenges facing local small business communities, the trends of consumer choices
			between main streets, malls, and online have not been linear or as catastrophic as some had
			predicted. This report sorts out how the pandemic impacted consumer behaviors and what lessons
			can be learned for main street resiliency.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the Measuring Main Streets project we tracked the visitor levels of 60 main streets and 15
			regional shopping malls in the Toronto, Montreal, and Edmonton regions. The streets were
			chosen to be representative of location, form, and demographics/equity. These were grouped
			into three broad categories of downtown (workplace oriented), small town, and urban/suburban
			(residential oriented). The visitor data dates to the beginning of 2019 and enables the
			comparison of visitor levels through to the end of 2022 on a monthly basis for individual
			streets or groups of streets according to type.
		</p>
		<p>
			The pandemic began to heavily impact the lives of Canadians in March of 2020. Hard lockdowns
			were imposed in many places while fear and uncertainty dominated personal decisions. During
			these early months visitor levels to main streets and malls dropped off precipitously. By
			April 2020, visitor levels to all types of main streets in Toronto, Montreal and Edmonton fell
			by at least half with downtown main streets dropping below 30% of pre-pandemic levels.
			Regional shopping malls were the most affected by hard lockdowns, falling to 15% of
			pre-pandemic visitor levels.
		</p>
		<p>
			Recovery trajectories also varied significantly by specific context. Small town main streets
			and residentially oriented main streets recovered more quickly than ones in downtowns. Much of
			this was due to a shift to work-from-home arrangements that heavily impacted office tower
			occupancy in city centers. As people worked from home more often, they are likely to have
			shifted some of their consumption patterns to their neighbourhood main street. By the end of
			2022, 9 out of the 75 case study main streets and shopping malls had fully recovered (or
			exceeded 2019 visitor levels). Five of these main streets were in small towns and four
			anchored residential neighbourhoods. Regional shopping malls typically experienced a series of
			V-shaped sharp declines and rebounds in relation to hard lockdowns. In aggregate, these spiky
			patterns did not add up to a full recovery for the studied malls by the 2022. Overall,
			regional shopping malls did not end 2022 in great shape, but they did outperform downtown
			oriented main streets by a significant margin.

			Regional shopping malls do not typically provide the same range of offerings as main streets.
			Measuring Main Streets identifies businesses (retail; bars & restaurants; local services) and
			civic infrastructure (arts & culture; recreation; education; health & care; government &
			community services) that are commonly found in main street environments. For the average main
			street, civic infrastructure accounts for slightly more than 20% of all establishments â€“
			though for some it is significantly higher. This is contrast to regional shopping malls where
			on average civic infrastructure accounts for only 8% of establishments. Only one regional
			shopping center in the study (Millwoood Town Center) provides civic infrastructure at the rate
			of typical main street.

			A key difference between main streets and regional shopping centers is the extent to which
			they support independent business. Measuring Main Streets developed an Independent Index to
			assess the relative balance between one-off independent businesses and establishments that are
			parts of chains. The index considers the size of the chain so that smaller local ones are not
			equated with large international chains. A score closer to one means that an area has a
			greater share of independent business relative to chains (and closer to zero should be read as
			a higher share of chain businesses). The average Independent Business Index score for the 60
			main street case studies was 0.74 in comparison to 0.30 for the 15 regional shopping malls.
			Main streets clearly provide significantly more opportunities for locally owned independent
			business. Such businesses are also more likely to provides goods and services that are more
			closely aligned with the nuances of local communities.

			Regional shopping malls tend to serve a wider catchment area than neighbourhood oriented main
			streets. The average trip distance to the 15 regional shopping malls in 2022 was 10km versus
			7.8km for neigbourhood main streets. Small town and downtown mains streets trip distance
			profiles are more aligned with that of regional shopping malls than neighbourhood main streets
			but for different reasons. Small town main streets typically serve low-density and rural
			communities while downtowns main streets draw people from all parts of the city. Average trip
			distances to all types of main streets as well as shopping malls fell significantly through
			the pandemic (2020-2021) before beginning to revert to historical levels in 2022. As people
			travelled less during the pandemic there were significant reductions in average household
			greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020 there was a reduction of 17.3% in 2020 followed by a further
			drop of 0.5% in 2021. This highlights the possible environmental benefits of providing
			essential goods and services on main streets in more densely populated neighbourhoods.

			As all types of physical locations showed declines in activity in the early stages of the
			pandemic, e-commerce boomed. April 2020 saw that share of e-commerce of all retail trade rise
			above 10% for the first time. Prior to the pandemic, e-commerce accounted for a rising share
			of the value of retail transactions but had yet to breach the 4% mark. This sudden spike led
			to many predictions that this was an inevitable acceleration of an existing trend that would
			continue beyond the end of the pandemic. These predictions did not come to fruition as
			e-commerce stayed well above expected levels for the core two years of the pandemic before
			retreating to the historic trend. While the pandemic does not seem to have accelerated a
			consumer shift to online retail, the long-term pattern rate continues to steadily rise.

			There was also a notable increase in online orders for restaurant meals during the pandemic.
			By 2021 online restaurant revenue had risen by an estimated 90% from pre-pandemic (2019)
			amounts (DoorDash/Restaurants Canada, 2022) This was a lifesaver for many main street
			businesses that saw their in-person dining levels evaporate in the early stages of the
			pandemic. The trajectory of restaurant revenues was very similar to that of regional shopping
			malls in that there were very sharp drop-offs during hard lockdowns and quick recoveries (see
			figure). Full-service restaurants and drinking places (bars) experienced deeper loses of
			revenue than limited-service restaurants (fast food) as they are almost entirely dependent on
			in-person consumption. Fast food restaurants were better positioned to adjust through online
			orders, deliveries, and service windows. As a result, they managed to exceed pre-pandemic
			sales levels by the summer of 2021. The dowxtnside to (independent) businesses is that many
			online ordering and deliveries are mediated by third parties that capture most, if not all, of
			the extra revenue (McKinsey). The potential downside to main streets is that more people
			choosing to staying home rather than visiting in person reduces the overall vibrancy and
			experience which can in turn undermine general recovery efforts.

		<h3>Summary of Key Findings</h3>
		<p>
			The pandemic significantly altered the everyday choices for most people in most places. We are only beginning to understand which pandemic-induced behaviors were temporary and which ones will become longer-lasting habits. The data in this report suggest xxx main findings: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>downtown main streets were hit hard by the pandemic and have not fully recovered;</li>
			<li>regional shopping malls experienced similar visitor drop-offs to main streets, have had uneven recoveries, and in many cases remain behind residential and small-town main streets relative to pre-pandemic levels;</li>
			<li>main streets contain a higher level of civic infrastructure than regional shopping malls;</li>
			<li>main streets provide more opportunities for independent business than regional shopping malls;</li>
			<li>residential neighbourhood main streets typically serve more local-based visitors involving shorter average trip distances</li>
			<li>e-commerce was on the ascendancy prior to the pandemic, experienced sharp increases during the pandemic, but has returned to historical trends, and;</li>
			<li>fast-food restaurants more than sit-down restaurants have managed to increase sales with the help of online ordering and delivery options but often lose that revenue to third party intermediaries.</li> 
			
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="text-container">
	<div class="report-text">
		<h3>Recommendations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Use data to identify gaps between local consumption demand and local consumption opportunities.</li>
			<li>Strengthen civic infrastructure opportunities that fulfill a wider range of residents' needs while reinforcing a sense of community.</li>
			<li>Help businesses adopt digital technologies while finding local solutions to implementation that retain capital in the community.</li>
			<li>Most trips are local â€“ make getting to/from the easiest and most convenient choice by investing in active transportation options.</li>
			<li>Downtowns need to adjust to post-pandemic realities of working from home â€“ they should look at altering the mix of businesses (more experiential?) as well as adding more housing/residents.</li>
			<li>Focus on the overall experience â€“ make it the most pleasant and enjoyable option â€“ lean into the local character and sense of community (authenticity).</li>
