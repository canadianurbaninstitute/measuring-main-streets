		Main streets were experiencing serious headwinds before the onset of the pandemic in the form of
		competition from shopping malls and shifting consumer behavior to online retailing. At the
		outset of the pandemic there were many doomsday predictions for main streets as online retailing
		spiked. It was seen as an acceleration of on inevitable trend that would lead to the shuttering
		of many bricks and mortar (independent) businesses. While there are a stack of related
		challenges facing local small business communities, the trends of consumer choices between main
		streets, malls, and online have not been linear or as catastrophic as some had predicted. This
		report sorts out how the pandemic impacted consumer behaviors and what lessons can be learned
		for main street resiliency.

			<h3>Visitor Levels</h3> 
			<p>
				For the Measuring Main Streets project we tracked the visitor levels of 60 main streets and
				15 regional shopping malls in the Toronto, Montreal, and Edmonton regions. The streets were
				chosen to be representative of location, form, and demographics/equity. These were grouped
				into three broad categories of downtown (workplace oriented), small town, and urban/suburban
				(residential oriented). The visitor data dates to the beginning of 2019 and enables the
				comparison of visitor levels through to the end of 2022 on a monthly basis for individual
				streets or groups of streets according to type.
			</p>
			<p>
				The pandemic began to heavily impact the lives of Canadians in March of 2020. Hard lockdowns
				were imposed in many places while fear and uncertainty dominated personal decisions. During
				these early months visitor levels to main streets and malls dropped off precipitously. By
				April 2020, visitor levels to all types of main streets in Toronto, Montreal and Edmonton
				fell by at least half with downtown main streets dropping below 30% of pre-pandemic levels.
				Regional shopping malls were the most affected by hard lockdowns, falling to 15% of
				pre-pandemic visitor levels.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recovery trajectories also varied significantly by specific context. Small town main streets
				and residentially oriented main streets recovered more quickly than ones in downtowns. Much
				of this was due to a shift to work-from-home arrangements that heavily impacted office tower
				occupancy in city centers. As people worked from home more often, they are likely to have
				shifted some of their consumption patterns to their neighbourhood main street. By the end of
				2022, 9 out of the 75 case study main streets and shopping malls had fully recovered (or
				exceeded 2019 visitor levels). Five of these main streets were in small towns and four
				anchored residential neighbourhoods. Regional shopping malls typically experienced a series
				of V-shaped sharp declines and rebounds in relation to hard lockdowns. In aggregate, these
				spiky patterns did not add up to a full recovery for the studied malls by the 2022. Overall,
				regional shopping malls did not end 2022 in great shape, but they did outperform downtown
				oriented main streets by a significant margin.

			<h3>Civic Infrastructure</h3> 
			<p>
				Regional shopping malls do not typically provide the same range of offerings as main
				streets. Measuring Main Streets identifies businesses (retail; bars & restaurants; local
				services) and civic infrastructure (arts & culture; recreation; education; health & care;
				government & community services) that are commonly found in main street environments. For
				the average main street, civic infrastructure accounts for slightly more than 20% of all
				establishments â€“ though for some it is significantly higher. This is contrast to regional
				shopping malls where on average civic infrastructure accounts for only 8% of establishments.
				Only one regional shopping center in the study (Millwoood Town Center) provides civic
				infrastructure at the rate of typical main street.

			<h3>Business Independence</h3> 
			<p>
				A key difference between main streets and regional shopping centers is the extent to which
				they support independent business. Measuring Main Streets developed an Independent Index to
				assess the relative balance between one-off independent businesses and establishments that
				are parts of chains. The index considers the size of the chain so that smaller local ones
				are not equated with large international chains. A score closer to one means that an area
				has a greater share of independent business relative to chains (and closer to zero should be
				read as a higher share of chain businesses). The average Independent Business Index score
				for the 60 main street case studies was 0.74 in comparison to 0.30 for the 15 regional
				shopping malls. Main streets clearly provide significantly more opportunities for locally
				owned independent business. Such businesses are also more likely to provides goods and
				services that are more closely aligned with the nuances of local communities.

			<h3>Distance Travelled</h3> 
			<p>
				Regional shopping malls tend to serve a wider catchment area than neighbourhood oriented
				main streets. The average trip distance to the 15 regional shopping malls in 2022 was 10km
				versus 7.8km for neigbourhood main streets. Small town and downtown mains streets trip
				distance profiles are more aligned with that of regional shopping malls than neighbourhood
				main streets but for different reasons. Small town main streets typically serve low-density
				and rural communities while downtowns main streets draw people from all parts of the city.
				Average trip distances to all types of main streets as well as shopping malls fell
				significantly through the pandemic (2020-2021) before beginning to revert to historical
				levels in 2022. As people travelled less during the pandemic there were significant
				reductions in average household greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020 there was a reduction of
				17.3% in 2020 followed by a further drop of 0.5% in 2021. This highlights the possible
				environmental benefits of providing essential goods and services on main streets in more
				densely populated neighbourhoods.

			<h3>Ecommerce</h3> 
			<p>
				As all types of physical locations showed declines in activity in the early stages of the
				pandemic, e-commerce boomed. April 2020 saw that share of e-commerce of all retail trade
				rise above 10% for the first time. Prior to the pandemic, e-commerce accounted for a rising
				share of the value of retail transactions but had yet to breach the 4% mark. This sudden
				spike led to many predictions that this was an inevitable acceleration of an existing trend
				that would continue beyond the end of the pandemic. These predictions did not come to
				fruition as e-commerce stayed well above expected levels for the core two years of the
				pandemic before retreating to the historic trend. While the pandemic does not seem to have
				accelerated a consumer shift to online retail, the long-term pattern rate continues to
				steadily rise.

			<h3>Restaurants</h3> 

			<p>
				There was also a notable increase in online orders for restaurant meals during the pandemic.
				By 2021 online restaurant revenue had risen by an estimated 90% from pre-pandemic (2019)
				amounts (DoorDash/Restaurants Canada, 2022) This was a lifesaver for many main street
				businesses that saw their in-person dining levels evaporate in the early stages of the
				pandemic. The trajectory of restaurant revenues was very similar to that of regional
				shopping malls in that there were very sharp drop-offs during hard lockdowns and quick
				recoveries (see figure). Full-service restaurants and drinking places (bars) experienced
				deeper loses of revenue than limited-service restaurants (fast food) as they are almost
				entirely dependent on in-person consumption. Fast food restaurants were better positioned to
				adjust through online orders, deliveries, and service windows. As a result, they managed to
				exceed pre-pandemic sales levels by the summer of 2021. The dowxtnside to (independent)
				businesses is that many online ordering and deliveries are mediated by third parties that
				capture most, if not all, of the extra revenue (McKinsey). The potential downside to main
				streets is that more people choosing to staying home rather than visiting in person reduces
				the overall vibrancy and experience which can in turn undermine general recovery efforts.
