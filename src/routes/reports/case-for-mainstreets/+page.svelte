		Main streets are the backbone of Canadian society. They provide local access to daily necessities that are foundational to the well-being of residents. Nearly 30 million Canadians (75%) live within one kilometre of a main street. Over 160,000 main street businesses provide 1.7 million jobs and generate $250 billion in revenue. Beyond the sheer economic power of main streets, they also play an essential role in civil society. They are gathering places where personal relationships are created and strengthened. To this point, there are over 52,000 locations of community and civic infrastructure on main streets. Furthermore, dense, walkable main streets have positive impacts on environmental sustainability as well as personal health. In short, vibrant main streets create thriving neighbourhoods, thriving neighbourhoods produce healthy cities, and healthy cities underpin a prosperous country. 	</p>
	<p>
		Unfortunately, not all is well on main street. The COVID pandemic led to drastically reduced visitor levels and caused many businesses to suffer. Places that experienced prolonged stress were highly vulnerable to negative cycles of reduced footfall, store vacancies, and diminishing perceptions. In some cases, main streets saw drop-offs to 25% of pre-pandemic visitor levels which persisted for two full years. Many main streets, especially ones closer to city-centres, remain below 2019 visitor levels. Even before the pandemic, main streets were experiencing significant challenges from long-running shifts to online and big-box consumer behaviour. We cannot afford to let our main streets decline. They must be cherished and invested in if our country is going to flourish. 	</p>

	<h3>Project Overview</h3> 
	<p>
		Measuring Main Streets provides research, data, and tools that inform infrastructure investment decisions that are intended to strengthen main streets and their surrounding environments. The project received $600,000 in funding from Infrastructure Canada’s (INFC) through its Research and Knowledge Initiative (RKI). The goals of the project are to:		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>understand the current state of Canada’s main streets;</li>
			<li>devise a methodology for evaluating public infrastructure assets and impact on main street vibrancy and resiliency;</li>
			<li>identify, collect and analyze baseline data, observational research and best practices, and;</li>
			<li>develop smart tools and recommendations to inform future infrastructure investment. </li>
		</ul>
	<p>Measuring Main Streets is constructed around three interrelated components: an interactive national map of that provides basic descriptive data for every main street in the country; a set of 30 full case studies across 10 regions (Toronto; Montreal; Edmonton) that included direct observational research as well as 30 data-only case studies; and a set of research briefs that outline key findings and messages. </p>

	<h3>A National Map of Main Streets</h3> 
	<p>
		Measuring Main Streets provide users with the ability to locate every main street across the country and retrieve associated data that describes the local context. One of the key contributions of this project is the creation of a standardized method for defining and identifying main streets across the country. This enables the direct comparison of main streets in a consistent manner essential for developing research findings that provide lessons for those involved in policy making and investment decisions. The methodology itself involves mapping the densities of main street businesses (i.e. retail; restaurants; local services) and civic infrastructure locations (i.e. arts & culture; education; health & care; recreation; government & community services) in relation to major roadways. This process segmented streets into high density main streets (i.e. traditional/walkable), low density main streets (i.e. car-oriented), and other major streets that do not have enough density to be consider a ‘true’ main street. On the national map section of the platform, users can click on any of these street segments and obtain general information about the street’s content (i.e. number of businesses; number of civic infrastructure) and the characteristics of the surrounding neighbourhood (i.e. demographics; housing stock; employment density). The national set of main streets can be classified and compared based on any of these indicators.

	<h3>Main Street Case Studies</h3> 
	<p>
		All main streets provide a range of goods and services as well as opportunities for people to congregate and interact. Yet no two main streets are exactly the same. Measuring Main Streets provides a set of 30 main street cases studies that combine detailed data profiles and direct observational research. An additional 30 data-only (no observational research) fill out a larger set of 60 across the three regions of Toronto, Montreal, and Edmonton. The case studies were selected to cover a range of contexts, from downtown main streets to small town main streets and many kinds of neighbourhoods in between. These case studies are intended to provide a foundation for the research briefs as well as lend detail and examples to specific findings. They also encapsulate the range of forms that main streets can take. The case studies include rich detail on the urban form, civic infrastructure, businesses, employment, housing, demographics, and visitor levels and characteristics. The data is reinforced by observations and photographs to paint a clearer picture of each main street environment.

	<h3>Main Street Research Briefs</h3> 
	<p>
		In addition to offering a range of interactive data, the Measuring Main Streets platform also provides a set of research briefs that give insights into the dynamics between main streets and civic infrastructure. These insights are intended to generate key messages for policy making and infrastructure investment decisions. The briefs are organized on three main themes: resiliency; equity; and community. The big takeaways across the set of reports are that the most resilient and equitable streets are the ones that primarily focus on the needs of their immediate local residential populations and create a sense of community through independent business and responsive civic infrastructure. This has significant implications going forward as downtown main streets need to adjust to a post-pandemic city with more people working from home. Additionally, newly planned suburban neighbourhoods will be more resilient and equitable if they reintroduce main streets as their central feature. Three further reports, one for each of Toronto, Montreal, and Edmonton further explore these themes on a regional level and draw connections with the case studies. A report commissioned to Open North that provides specific advice on how to incorporate data into main street decision making rounds out the set.

	<h3>Main Street Data Tools and Applications</h3> 
	<p>
		Using the main street as a unit of analysis is a novel approach to understanding urban form and neighbourhood dynamics. Measuring Main Streets provides a set of tools for exploring and visualizing a wide range of data at this scale. This includes interactive maps and charts that help users gain a deeper appreciation of how main streets can shape local communities and ultimately contribute to more resilient and equitable cities. These tools will continue to grow and expand as the measuring main streets platform continues to evolve. The platform is intended to serve a greater purpose than its project-based origins and become a hub for activities that support main street policy making and infrastructure decisions. Measuring Main Streets is already supporting other CUI programs (My Main Streets - FedDev), research projects (Housing on Main Streets – CMHC), and other client work (Ontario Line Construction Impact Dashboards – City of Toronto). More are on the way. 					</p>

	<h3>Using the Measuring Main Street Platform</h3> 
	<p>
		Measuring Main Streets is designed as an interactive platform and not as a research report. There is no single beginning or end as it is intended to be experienced in a variety of ways. We hope that as you navigate your way through it that you will find data and analysis that helps you make the case for action in your own main street environment. As it continues to grow and evolve, we would appreciate your feedback on how to improve it going forward. If you have any questions or interest in exploring further opportunities please do not hesitate to get in touch. 			</p>
